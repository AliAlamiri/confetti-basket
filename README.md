#Programming for Games Errata Collab

Contains a very barebones set up of markdown and CSS stylesheets
daisy-chained (concatenated) using a makefile. Clone the repo and run make to generate
a Presentation.html which can then be saved in Chrome as a .PDF using
File > Print which we can use to send as the final copy.

#Usage

Markup the errata inside a code tag with class as "error", so:

<code class="error">
void upDateVel(double newVelocity);
</code>

Mark up comments as blockquotes before every question

> In this manner

That's all, rest is pure [Markdown Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

#Contribute
