#Programming for Games Collab

Contains a very barebones set up of markdown and CSS stylesheets
daisy-chained (concatenated) using a makefile. Clone the repo and run make to generate
a Presentation.html which can then be saved in Chrome as a .PDF using
File > Print which we can use to send as the final copy.
